# Quadratic_Sieve_Parallel

Final Project with Tai Thongthai for Parallel and Distributed Systems for Parallel and Distributed Systems course. 

Project compared different parallelizations for particular steps of the Quadratic Sieve attack algorithm. 

Code for implementation and final paper are included in this repository.
